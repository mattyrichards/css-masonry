## css-masonry

Masonry layout built entirely with CSS. Using the CSS3 rule 'column-count' we can
easily create a masonry type layout without having to resort to JavaScript. Using an Autoprefixer in the build,
we can ensure this CSS is [cross-browser compatible back to IE10](http://caniuse.com/#feat=multicolumn).

Responsiveness is extremely easy. We simply adjust the number of columns on our breakpoints. See the source Sass file for
more details.

Working demo can be [found here](http://www.kreative.co.uk/github/css-masonry).
